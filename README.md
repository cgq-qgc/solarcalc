The SolarcCalc module is used to predict hourly global solar
radiation on a horizontal surface from daily average temperature
extremes and total precipitation records.
The method used in the calculations is based on that presented in
[An Introduction to Environmental Biophysics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-1626-1)
by Campbell, G.S. and J.M. Norman (1998).
<br><br>
Version 1.0 of the SolarcCalc module is based on the source code of
SolarCalc.jar (version 1.1, Jan. 2006), a computer program  that was
developped by the USDA Agricultural Research Service and that is
available free of charge at [https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/solarcalc-10](https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/solarcalc-10).
<br><br>
Subsequent versions of the SolarcCalc module implemented performance
improvements and fixed some issues with the original code and method.
